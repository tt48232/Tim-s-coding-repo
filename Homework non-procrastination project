project idea: A things that is able to remind me, or get me to do my homework, and not put it off.

some sort of input into a device that annoyes me enough to do my homework (current idea; something like a keycard)

Flowchart: 

use code to code a machine
signal gets sent out, if not, machine checks to see if a code was sent out
machine does something(idk yet), if not, the code refreshes
some sort of counter singal is sent out when something is done, in case it's not the original signal will have a counter code that will turn off the orignal signal after a certain time delay
stops action of machine untill told again, or some sort of time-out feature

Learning list: idk yet 
some sort of signaling code
hardware programming
any sort of code needed (python, C/C++ java. ect.)
imports/signaling code



tasklists:

get something to get a sensory output
don't know what the signal/processor going to be
